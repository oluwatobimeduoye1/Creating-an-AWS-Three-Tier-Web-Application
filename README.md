# Creating-an-AWS-Three-Tier-Web-Application
This project sets up a secure and scalable three-tier architecture on AWS using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It includes Amazon RDS for the database tier, EC2 instances for the application and web tiers, and integrates a load balancer with autoscaling for optimized performance, traffic distribution, and high availability.
